# <Bootcamp mod 1 challenge>

## Description

A challenge to perform a code refactoring task by examing an excisting code for a website.

The codebase was adjusted to follow accessibility standards in order to be optimized for search engines.

The source code included the use of semantic HTML elements and follows a logical sturucture aside from styling and positioning. The images have alt attributes added, the heading attributes fall in sequential order and the title has been changed to name of the company.

Links that were not working have been fixed, specifically the "Search Engine Optimization" header, which now links to the correct section.
